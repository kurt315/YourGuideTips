  <p><strong>Published:</strong> May 2025</p>

  <p>Filipino cuisine is a delightful fusion of indigenous, Spanish, Chinese, and American influences, making it one of the most unique and flavorful in Southeast Asia. If you’re looking to explore the rich flavors of the Philippines, there are certain dishes that should not be missed. From savory stews to fresh seafood and sweet desserts, Filipino dishes offer something for everyone.</p>

  <p>This article highlights 10 Filipino dishes you should try, showcasing the diversity and deliciousness of Filipino food. Whether you're visiting the Philippines or exploring Filipino flavors at home, these dishes are a must-try!</p>

  <h3>1. Adobo</h3>
  <p>Adobo is considered the unofficial national dish of the Philippines. This savory stew is made by marinating meat—usually chicken, pork, or beef—in vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns before it’s simmered to perfection. It’s rich in flavor and can be served with steamed rice, which balances out the tanginess and richness of the dish.</p>

  <p>The beauty of adobo lies in its versatility. You’ll find regional variations throughout the country, with some adding coconut milk (known as *adobong gata*), potatoes, or even pineapple to the mix. This dish is often enjoyed with a cold glass of iced tea, making it a comforting and satisfying meal.</p>

  <h3>2. Sinigang na Baboy</h3>
  <p>Sinigang is a tangy, savory soup that’s perfect for a warm, rainy day. The most popular version is *sinigang na baboy* (pork sinigang), where pork belly or ribs are simmered with vegetables like kangkong (water spinach), labanos (radish), eggplant, and string beans. The star of the dish is the sour broth, traditionally made with tamarind, which gives it its signature tangy flavor.</p>

  <p>Sinigang can also be made with shrimp, fish, or beef, and the level of sourness can be adjusted to suit your taste. The dish is typically served with steamed rice, and many people love to dip their rice into the flavorful broth.</p>

  <h3>3. Lechon</h3>
  <p>Lechon is a whole roasted pig that is marinated with a blend of spices, herbs, and sometimes even coca cola, before being slow-cooked over an open flame. The skin becomes perfectly crispy while the meat stays juicy and tender. Lechon is a dish reserved for special occasions and celebrations in the Philippines, often the centerpiece of big gatherings.</p>

  <p>The dish is usually served with *sarsa* (a liver-based sauce) or vinegar and soy sauce. If you visit the Philippines, don’t miss out on the chance to try lechon in areas like Cebu, which is famous for its version of this dish. Lechon is often enjoyed with a side of rice and is a great way to experience Filipino hospitality at its finest.</p>

  <h3>4. Pancit</h3>
  <p>Pancit is a general term for noodles in the Philippines, but the most popular versions are *pancit canton* (stir-fried noodles) and *pancit Malabon* (thick noodles with a seafood-based sauce). Noodles hold significant cultural importance, as they symbolize long life and good fortune. Pancit is often served during birthdays and celebrations.</p>

  <p>In *pancit canton*, stir-fried noodles are mixed with vegetables, meat (like chicken, pork, or shrimp), and seasoned with soy sauce and spices. It’s a hearty and satisfying dish, and each region in the Philippines has its own take on it. Pancit Malabon, on the other hand, is made with thicker noodles and a sauce made from shrimp paste and seafood, giving it a unique, savory flavor.</p>

  <h3>5. Kare-Kare</h3>
  <p>Kare-Kare is a rich, flavorful stew made with oxtail, tripe, and sometimes beef or pork, all cooked in a thick peanut sauce. This dish is often served with a side of *bagoong* (fermented shrimp paste) to add a salty contrast to the sweetness of the peanut sauce. The dish is typically enjoyed with rice, and the mix of tender meat, creamy sauce, and vegetables like banana hearts, eggplant, and string beans make it a delightful meal.</p>

  <p>Kare-Kare is a comfort food that’s popular during special occasions. The creamy peanut sauce is rich and indulgent, and the pairing of *bagoong* balances it perfectly. It’s a must-try dish for anyone looking to experience Filipino food in its full glory.</p>

  <h3>6. Halo-Halo</h3>
  <p>Halo-Halo is a popular Filipino dessert that’s perfect for hot weather. This refreshing treat is made by combining shaved ice with a variety of sweet ingredients like ube (purple yam), leche flan, sweetened beans, coconut, and jackfruit. It’s topped with a scoop of ice cream, making it a fun, colorful, and indulgent dessert.</p>

  <p>The name “halo-halo” means “mix-mix” in Tagalog, and that’s exactly what you do: mix everything together to create a sweet, creamy concoction that’s absolutely delicious. Every bite is a mix of textures, from the crunchy shaved ice to the creamy ube and soft beans. Halo-Halo is a must-try during the summer months or whenever you need a sweet treat!</p>

  <h3>7. Lumpia</h3>
  <p>Lumpia is the Filipino version of spring rolls, and they come in two main types: *lumpiang shanghai* (fried) and *lumpiang sariwa* (fresh). *Lumpiang shanghai* is made with ground pork, shrimp, and vegetables wrapped in a thin spring roll wrapper and then deep-fried to crispy perfection. It’s often served with a sweet-and-sour dipping sauce.</p>

  <p>*Lumpiang sariwa*, on the other hand, is a healthier version that’s made by wrapping vegetables, sometimes with meat, in a soft crepe-like wrapper. It’s typically topped with a garlic-peanut sauce, making it a lighter and equally delicious option.</p>

  <h3>8. Bicol Express</h3>
  <p>Bicol Express is a flavorful dish made with pork, shrimp, or fish cooked in a rich coconut milk sauce with spicy chili peppers. Originating from the Bicol region of the Philippines, this dish is known for its creamy texture and fiery heat. The combination of spicy chilies and the richness of the coconut milk creates a mouthwatering balance.</p>

  <p>If you enjoy spicy food, Bicol Express will be a treat for you. It pairs beautifully with steamed rice and can be adjusted for heat depending on how much chili is used. The dish showcases the Filipino love for coconut milk and spicy flavors, making it a favorite among spice lovers.</p>

  <h3>9. Bibingka</h3>
  <p>Bibingka is a traditional Filipino rice cake that’s commonly served during Christmas but is delicious year-round. It’s made from rice flour, coconut milk, sugar, and eggs, then baked in banana leaves, which impart a unique aroma to the dish. The top is often sprinkled with salted duck egg and cheese, adding a savory contrast to the sweetness of the cake.</p>

  <p>Often enjoyed with a hot cup of coffee or hot chocolate, bibingka is perfect for breakfast or as a snack. Its soft, slightly chewy texture and sweet and salty flavors make it a beloved treat throughout the country.</p>

  <h3>10. Puto</h3>
  <p>Puto is another traditional Filipino steamed rice cake, but it differs from bibingka in that it’s typically lighter and fluffier. Made from rice flour, sugar, and coconut milk, *puto* is often topped with a slice of salted duck egg or cheese. It’s served as a snack or dessert and is commonly paired with savory dishes like *sinigang* or *adobo* to balance out the flavors.</p>

  <p>Puto is often sold by street vendors or in Filipino restaurants, and it’s a great dish to try when you want to sample Filipino snacks. Whether you enjoy it sweet or savory, it’s a versatile dish that’s beloved across the Philippines.</p>
